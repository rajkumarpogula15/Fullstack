# Fullstack Repository

**Owner:** rajkumarpogula15

This repository houses a collection of full-stack development projects, examples, and practice code spanning various popular technology stacks, primarily utilizing JavaScript on the frontend/backend where applicable.

## 🚀 Overview

The `Fullstack` repository is designed to serve as a central hub for exploring and developing applications across different technology stacks. It is organized by the backend framework/technology used, demonstrating common architectural patterns and implementation details.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is structured to separate distinct projects or technology stacks into dedicated directories:

```
.
├── 📁 Express/         # Backend projects/examples using the Express.js framework (Node.js/JavaScript)
├── 📁 Flask/           # Backend projects/examples using the Flask framework (Python)
├── 📁 GearPoint/       # Specific application project named "GearPoint"
├── 📁 React/           # Frontend projects/examples built with the React library
├── 📁 practice/        # General code snippets, algorithms, and smaller practice exercises
├── 📁 web/             # Potentially generic or legacy web-related files
├── 📄 README.md        # This file
└── ...
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Explored

While the repository structure suggests exposure to different backend languages (Node/Python), the primary focus, as indicated by the repository language tag, leans towards **JavaScript/TypeScript** implementations.

*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Backend (JS):** Express.js
*   **Backend (Other):** Flask (Python)

## 💡 Getting Started

To explore or run a specific project within this repository, navigate to its corresponding directory.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary runtime environments installed for the specific folder you wish to examine (e.g., Node.js for `Express` and `React`, Python for `Flask`).

### Installation Example (Express Project)

If you wish to run an application within the `Express` directory:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rajkumarpogula15/Fullstack.git
    cd Fullstack/Express/your-project-name # Replace with the actual project folder
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server (command may vary):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

**Note:** Specific setup instructions for individual projects residing in subdirectories like `GearPoint` or `React` will be located within their respective folders (e.g., in their own `README.md` or configuration files).

## 🤝 Contributing
